I am a data scientist specialized in data visualization, spatial data, and statistical computing. I work at the methodology department at [Statistics Netherlands](https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/), where I do a mix of consultancy, teaching, and conducting applied academic research.

My academic career started in knowledge engineering and game theory at Maastricht University. After completing my Ph.D. in 2010, I shifted my research focus to data science and visualization. I have collaborated extensively with other universities, including Eindhoven University, the University of MÃ¼nster, and the University of Oxford.

I am passionate about open-source software. I am the main author of several popular R packages, including [tmap](https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap/) and [cols4all](https://cols4all.github.io/cols4all-R/), which are widely used by researchers and data visualization professionals worldwide.

In my free time, I enjoy playing [guitar](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1r0UM2CTI9nvqjsXN5ihNa), doing outdoor sports, and spending time with my family.
